                <p>
                    You are no longer able to trade options on any of our platforms.
                    Also, you canâ€™t make deposits into your Options Account.
                </p>
                <strong>Withdraw all your funds</strong>
                <p>You will lose access to your Options Account when it gets closed,
                    so be sure to withdraw all your funds. (If you have a CFDs Account,
                    you can also transfer the funds from your Options Account to your CFDs Account.)
